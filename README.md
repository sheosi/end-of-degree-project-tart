 #end-of-degree-project-tart

 This is my end-of-degree project, it describes the base of a game engine which
 uses a work-stealing job and lock-free algorithms in order to have to take
 profit from as much cores as possible.

Is implemented in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) for ergonomics and so that I made everything from scratch
(the best way to understand what is behind everything in my opinion).

This has actually some years (around 3 at this point), so expect bugs and things
that aren't 100% correct.

I don't expect to fix anything in here anytime soon, but feel free to ask if
there's something that you want to know.

The images inside 'images' (except 'Nim.svg', 'The_C_Programming_Language_logo.svg', 'python-logo-inkscape.svg', 'LISP_logo.svg') have the license Creative Commons BY-4.0. Other files in that folder are owned by their respective propietaries (though the C one and Lisp should be 'open source' regardless, and you shouldn't have any problems using them, do check them out though).

Every other file is under the license Creative Commons BY-SA-4.0.

If any of this has helped you, I'll be glad to know about it.
